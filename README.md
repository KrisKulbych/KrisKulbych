Hi, I'm Kristina!

I'm a newbie programmer :sunglasses:... 

Honestly I'm just starting on the path of learning programming :sweat_smile:. I decided to start my learning journey with the Python.
I have a degree in civil engineering and I am current working as Technical Department Engineer in a building company, but in nearest future I have a goal to switch careers.

Big plans and may the force be with me! :nerd_face:

Thanks for visiting and I'd love to connect! :yum:

Have a nice day!
